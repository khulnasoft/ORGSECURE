### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named `ci.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Runs every Sunday at midnight

jobs:
  dependabot:
    name: Dependabot
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check for Dependabot updates
        uses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v1
        with:
          package-ecosystem: 'npm' # Change this according to your package manager
          directory: '/' # Location of package files
          schedule: 'daily' # Check for updates daily

  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14' # Specify your Node.js version

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  codeql:
    name: CodeQL Analysis
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/setup@v2
        with:
          languages: 'javascript' # Change this according to your project language

      - name: Initialize CodeQL database
        uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

      - name: Perform CodeQL analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
        with:
          category: 'security'

  security-checks:
    name: Security Checks
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run security checks
        run: |
          npm install -g npm audit
          npm audit
```

### Explanation of the Workflow

1. **Triggers**: The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch and any branches that match the `releases/*` pattern. It also runs on a weekly schedule.

2. **Dependabot Job**: This job checks for updates to dependencies using Dependabot. You can customize the `package-ecosystem` and `directory` according to your project.

3. **Test Job**: This job checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests. Adjust the Node.js version and test command as necessary for your project.

4. **CodeQL Analysis Job**: This job sets up CodeQL, initializes the database, and performs the analysis. You can specify the languages you want to analyze.

5. **Security Checks Job**: This job runs security checks using `npm audit`. You can modify this step to include other security tools as needed.

### Customization

- Adjust the `node-version` and `languages` according to your project's requirements.
- Modify the `npm test` command if you are using a different testing framework or command.
- If you are using a different package manager (like `yarn` or `pip`), update the installation and audit commands accordingly.

### Final Steps

After creating the `ci.yml` file, commit and push it to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically pick up the workflow and start running it based on the defined triggers.
